    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <p>Biryani is a popular and aromatic South Asian rice dish that has captivated food enthusiasts around the world with its rich flavors and diverse variations. This iconic dish typically consists of fragrant, long-grain rice (such as Basmati rice) cooked with a blend of spices, herbs, and a protein source like chicken,or vegetables. I like Biryani is renowned for its complex and harmonious blend of spices, which create a burst of flavors with each bite. The fragrant spices, such as cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron, contribute to its distinct aroma and taste.</p>
